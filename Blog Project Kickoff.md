# Linux Lighthouse Blog

The blog is a starting web presence to present or project in a fast but authentic way. Rather than run in stealth mode or operate solely on the GitHub repos and Discord chats. We need a place to point new team members and potential funders to our mission. We will build the platform as a separate site and combine them as needed.
