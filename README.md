## _BLUFF_

1. No one has given me any money yet. I have people working on that already. But anyone who wants to join that team is welcome.
2. I have not been made any promises from anyone signed contracts yet. Just people willing to help and talk to me. I have put out some names who are helping me. But I don‚Äôt know how far that will go. I have vetted them as real people. And real organizations.
3. It is still very early days.
4. My goal is to build this project into an organization I and a team can work on full time.
## üéØÔ∏è Goals

1. A modern platform to learn Linux and Open Source Software development for both the hobbyist and the professional
2. A modern platform to gain work experience to enter the Linux and open source job market
3. A modern and flexible talent pool platform to hire from
4. A modern and reliable platform to build a future forward Linux community of support.
