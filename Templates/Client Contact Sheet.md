Sure, here is a checklist of information you should consider including in your customer communication plan:

1. **Introduction**: Start with a brief introduction of yourself and your company. This helps establish a personal connection with the customer and sets the tone for the conversation.
    
2. **Purpose of the call**: Clearly state the purpose of the call and what you hope to achieve. This helps the customer understand what to expect from the conversation.
    
3. **Review of previous interactions**: If you have had previous interactions with the customer, take a moment to review them. This helps you understand the customer’s history and any issues they may have had in the past.
    
4. **Update on current status**: Provide an update on the current status of the customer’s issue or request. This helps the customer understand where things stand and what to expect going forward.
    
5. **Next steps**: Clearly outline the next steps that will be taken to resolve the issue or fulfill the request. This helps the customer understand what to expect and when.
    
6. **Timeline**: Provide a timeline for when the next steps will be taken and when the issue or request is expected to be resolved. This helps the customer plan accordingly.
    
7. **Action items**: Clearly outline any action items that the customer needs to take. This helps ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the issue or request is resolved as quickly as possible.
    
8. **Closing**: End the call with a brief summary of what was discussed and any next steps. Thank the customer for their time and let them know that you are available if they have any further questions or concerns.
