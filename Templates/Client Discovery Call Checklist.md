Sure, here is a checklist for a discovery call with a client:

1. **Research the client**: Before the call, research the clientâ€™s company and industry to understand their business needs and challenges. This will help you tailor your questions and solutions to their specific situation. [[Client Research Sheet]]
    
2. **Prepare an agenda**: Create an agenda for the call that outlines the topics you want to cover. Share the agenda with the client before the call so they can prepare any necessary information. [[Development/partner-repo/Templates/Client Discovery Meeting Agenda]]
    
3. **Introduce yourself and your company**: Start the call by introducing yourself and your company. Explain your role and how you can help the client. [[My elevator pitch]]
    
4. **Ask open-ended questions**: Ask open-ended questions to encourage the client to share their thoughts and ideas. Listen carefully to their responses and ask follow-up questions to clarify their needs.

5. **Discuss your solutions**: Share your solutions with the client and explain how they can help solve their business challenges. Be specific and provide examples of how your solutions have helped other clients. [[Solutions Pitch Deck]]
    
6. **Agree on next steps**: Agree on next steps with the client, such as scheduling a follow-up call or meeting. Summarize the key takeaways from the call and confirm any action items. [[Next Steps Action List]]
    
7. **Follow up**: After the call, send a follow-up email to the client summarizing the key points discussed and any action items. This will help ensure everyone is on the same page and moving forward. [[Follow Up Checklist]]
