Sure, here is a checklist for a discovery call with a client:

1. **Research the client**: Before the call, research the clientâ€™s company and industry to understand their business needs and challenges. This will help you tailor your questions and solutions to their specific situation.
    
2. **Prepare an agenda**: Create an agenda for the call that outlines the topics you want to cover. Share the agenda with the client before the call so they can prepare any necessary information.
    
3. **Introduce yourself and your company**: Start the call by introducing yourself and your company. Explain your role and how you can help the client.
    
4. **Ask open-ended questions**: Ask open-ended questions to encourage the client to share their thoughts and ideas. Listen carefully to their responses and ask follow-up questions to clarify their needs. [[Discovery Meeting Questions]]
    
5. **Discuss your solutions**: Share your solutions with the client and explain how they can help solve their business challenges. Be specific and provide examples of how your solutions have helped other clients.
    
6. **Agree on next steps**: Agree on next steps with the client, such as scheduling a follow-up call or meeting. Summarize the key takeaways from the call and confirm any action items.
    
7. **Follow up**: After the call, send a follow-up email to the client summarizing the key points discussed and any action items. This will help ensure everyone is on the same page and moving forward.
