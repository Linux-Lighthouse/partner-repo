As a freelance software developer, itâ€™s important to have a streamlined client onboarding process to ensure that you and your clients are on the same page. Here is a **six-step checklist** that you can use to onboard your clients:

1. **Send welcome documents**: Send a prepared welcome document to every new client that outlines your process, introduces your team, and reminds clients of your payment terms. This is also the point where you would send clients an intake form to get information like contact information for any points of contact you havenâ€™t met yet, project details like client goals and deadlines, links or access to documents like branding guidelines, guest access to internal platforms like Dropbox or Google Analytics, and information about internal subject matter experts and other knowledge resources you can use.
    
2. **Schedule a discovery call**: Schedule a call with your client to discuss their project in detail. This is a great opportunity to ask questions, clarify any doubts, and establish a rapport with your client.
    
3. **Forward your proposal**: After the discovery call, forward your proposal to the client. The proposal should include a detailed scope of work, timelines, deliverables, and pricing.
    
4. **Issue your contract**: Once the proposal is accepted, issue a contract to the client. The contract should include the scope of work, timelines, deliverables, pricing, payment terms, and any other relevant details.
    
5. **Send a deposit invoice**: After the contract is signed, send a deposit invoice to the client. The deposit should be a percentage of the total project cost and should be paid upfront.
    
6. **Arrange a kick-off meeting**: Finally, arrange a kick-off meeting with your client to discuss the project in detail, establish communication channels, and set expectations.
    

I hope this checklist helps you onboard your clients more efficiently. Good luck with your freelancing career! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
