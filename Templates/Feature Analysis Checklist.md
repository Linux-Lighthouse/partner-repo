Certainly! Here is a checklist to evaluate a new software product idea:

#Build #Checklist #Development #BlogIdea #Feature


1. **Conduct a needs analysis**: Identify the target outcome of using the software. Identify the key pain points you’re hoping to fix with it. For example, before evaluating an ecommerce system, you may want to ask yourself: Are we missing out on higher sales by not having our retail store online? Are our customers dissatisfied with the current user experience (UX)? Are the in-house server maintenance costs becoming too much? Will subscribing to a cloud-based tool make more sense? Understanding the “why” will make it easier to identify “how” to eliminate the irrelevant options.
    
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Identify the target outcome of using the software.
        - Identify the key pain points you’re hoping to fix with it.
        - Determine if the software is necessary.
        - Identify the target audience.
        - Identify the competition.
2. **Identify ‘must-have’ features**: After clearly understanding the pain points the tool will address, jot down a list of features that might help cater to those needs. In addition to the “must-have” features, also create a list of the “nice-to-have” features. If we take the ecommerce software example, a compelling image gallery and editor, checkout system, and shopping cart module might be your “must-have” features, whereas an automatically adjusting webpage color scheme could be a “nice-to-have” feature.
    
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Identify the “must-have” features.
        - Identify the “nice-to-have” features.
        - Prioritize the features.
        - Determine the feasibility of the features.
        - Determine the cost of the features.
3. **Select a vendor**: Pick a lasting partnership. Evaluate the vendor’s technical capabilities, performance, and total ownership cost. You’ll also need to factor in your business’s unique processes and requirements.
    
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Research potential vendors.
        - Evaluate the vendor’s technical capabilities.
        - Evaluate the vendor’s performance.
        - Evaluate the total ownership cost.
        - Factor in your business’s unique processes and requirements.
4. **Calculate the total cost of ownership**: Factor in the upfront and hidden costs. Determine the total cost of ownership of the software over its lifetime.
    
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Determine the upfront costs.
        - Determine the hidden costs.
        - Determine the lifetime cost.
        - Determine the return on investment.
        - Determine the break-even point.
5. **Speak with the stakeholders**: Decide as a team. Speak with the stakeholders to determine if the software is a good fit for the organization.
    
    - **Subtasks**:
        - Identify the stakeholders.
        - Schedule a meeting.
        - Present the software.
        - Discuss the software.
        - Make a decision.

I hope this helps!
