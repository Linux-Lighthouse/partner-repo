#Development #design #Checklist #Build 

Sure, here is a revised checklist with 5 additional sub-tasks for each item:

1. **Define the problem**:
    
    - Identify the problem that the new feature will solve. This will help you to determine the scope of the feature and its requirements.
    - Define the target audience for the feature.
    - Determine the impact of the feature on the existing system.
    - Identify the risks associated with the feature.
    - Define the success criteria for the feature.
2. **Research**:
    
    - Conduct research to determine if the feature already exists in the market. If it does, analyze how it works and what improvements can be made.
    - Research how similar problems have been solved in the past.
    - Identify the tools and technologies that will be required to develop the feature.
    - Determine the feasibility of the feature.
    - Identify the potential impact of the feature on the user experience.
3. **Create a product spec document**:
    
    - Create a document that outlines the featureâ€™s goals, user feedback, problem statement, solution outline, success criteria, requirements, and deliverables. This document will serve as a starting point for the design solution.
    - Define the timeline for the feature development.
    - Identify the stakeholders who will be involved in the feature development.
    - Define the budget for the feature development.
    - Identify the metrics that will be used to measure the success of the feature.
4. **Design the feature**:
    
    - Use the product spec document to design the feature. This includes creating user stories, mockups, and prototypes.
    - Define the user interface for the feature.
    - Identify the data sources that will be required for the feature.
    - Define the data model for the feature.
    - Identify the performance requirements for the feature.
5. **Develop the feature**:
    
    - Develop the feature using the design created in the previous step. This includes coding, testing, and debugging.
    - Create a test plan for the feature.
    - Define the coding standards that will be used for the feature development.
    - Identify the tools and technologies that will be used for the feature development.
    - Define the deployment strategy for the feature.
6. **Test the feature**:
    
    - Test the feature to ensure that it works as intended and meets the success criteria defined in the product spec document.
    - Perform unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
    - Identify and fix any bugs or issues that are found during testing.
    - Verify that the feature meets the performance requirements.
    - Verify that the feature meets the security requirements.
7. **Deploy the feature**:
    
    - Deploy the feature to the production environment.
    - Define the rollout strategy for the feature.
    - Verify that the feature is working as intended in the production environment.
    - Monitor the feature to ensure that it is performing as expected.
    - Provide training to the users on how to use the new feature.
8. **Monitor the feature**:
    
    - Monitor the feature to ensure that it is working as intended and to identify any issues that may arise.
    - Define the monitoring strategy for the feature.
    - Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure the success of the feature.
    - Analyze the data collected from the monitoring to identify areas for improvement.
    - Continuously optimize the feature based on the feedback received.
9. **Gather feedback**:
    
    - Gather feedback from users to determine if the feature is meeting their needs and if any improvements can be made.
    - Define the feedback collection strategy.
    - Analyze the feedback received to identify areas for improvement.
    - Prioritize the feedback based on its impact on the user experience.
    - Continuously improve the feature based on the feedback received.

I hope this helps!
