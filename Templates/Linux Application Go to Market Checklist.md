As an independent software developer, you can create a go-to-market (GTM) strategy for your Linux Desktop application by following these steps:

1. **Define your product**: Identify the unique problem that your application solves and how it is different from other Linux Desktop applications in the market.
2. **Identify your target audience**: Determine who your ideal customer is and what pain points they experience. This will help you tailor your messaging and marketing efforts to the right audience.
3. **Research your competition**: Analyze the demand and competition in the market you want to pursue. This will help you identify gaps in the market and differentiate your product from others.
4. **Create a marketing plan**: Develop a marketing plan that outlines how you will reach your target customers and create demand for your product. This could include social media marketing, email marketing, content marketing, and more.
5. **Set a pricing strategy**: Determine the price point for your application that is competitive and profitable.
6. **Develop a sales strategy**: Identify the channels through which you will sell your application, such as online marketplaces, direct sales, or partnerships.
7. **Create a launch plan**: Plan the launch of your application by setting a launch date, creating a press release, and developing a launch campaign.
8. **Measure your success**: Set metrics to measure the success of your GTM strategy, such as downloads, revenue, and customer feedback.
9. **Iterate and improve**: Continuously improve your GTM strategy based on the feedback and data you receive.
