# What is a GitHub wiki?

A GitHub wiki is a section of a GitHub repository that hosts documentation for your project. You can use a wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how to contribute to it, or how it works internally. A wiki is different from a README file, which provides a quick overview of your project and its features. A wiki allows you to organize your documentation into multiple pages and categories, and use various formats and features to enhance your content. For example, you can use Markdown or HTML to write your wiki pages, and add images, tables, code blocks, math expressions, diagrams, and more. You can also link to other wiki pages or external sources, and create a sidebar or a footer for easy navigation. A wiki is a collaborative tool that allows anyone with access to your repository to edit or create wiki pages, depending on the permissions you set. You can also track the changes made to your wiki using Git, and clone your wiki to your local machine for offline editing. [A wiki is a great way to document your project and make it easier for others to understand and use it](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis)[1](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)
