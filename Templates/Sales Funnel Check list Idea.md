It‚Äôs great to hear that you are building an open source software application. To build a sales funnel for donations, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a landing page**: A landing page is a web page that visitors land on after clicking on a link. It should be designed to convert visitors into donors. [You can use a tool like **ClickFunnels**](https://khrisdigital.com/clickfunnels-for-nonprofits/)[1](https://khrisdigital.com/clickfunnels-for-nonprofits/) to create a landing page.
    
2. **Offer a free trial**: Offering a free trial is a great way to get people to try your software. Once they see how useful it is, they will be more likely to donate. [You can use a tool like **Systeme.io**](https://khrisdigital.com/clickfunnels-for-nonprofits/)[2](https://www.funnelkarma.com/how-to-create-a-sales-funnel-for-beginners/) to create a free trial.
    
3. **Create a donation page**: A donation page is a web page where people can donate money to your project. [You can use a tool like **Classy**](https://khrisdigital.com/clickfunnels-for-nonprofits/)[3](https://www.classy.org/blog/master-donor-cultivation-funnel/) to create a donation page.
    
4. **Create a thank you page**: A thank you page is a web page that visitors see after they have donated. It should thank them for their donation and encourage them to share your project with others.
    
5. **Promote your project**: Promote your project on social media, forums, and other websites. [You can also use **content marketing**](https://khrisdigital.com/clickfunnels-for-nonprofits/)[4](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/sales-funnel-template/) to attract visitors to your website.
    
6. [**Track your progress**: Use a tool like **Zendesk**](https://khrisdigital.com/clickfunnels-for-nonprofits/)[5](https://www.zendesk.com/blog/sales-funnel-ultimate-guide/) to track your progress and see how many people are donating.
